# Amaaze
Amaaze is a game that allows you to design a maze on pen and paper and navigate through it on your phone. You can race against yourself or others when playing publicly shared mazes, while watching out for wormholes that randomly teleport the ball. Of course, you can keep your maze only to yourself as well. While this is an app for those who love designing on pen and paper and want to bring those creations to life, uses are infinite! Mazes and inspiration are everywhere!

## Main Features
- Snap pen-and-paper drawing (..or more!) to create maze
- Customise start and end points
- Navigate maze by moving your phone
- Get warped through randomly created wormholes
